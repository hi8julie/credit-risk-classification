# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of the analysis is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 
* The data for the used dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
* The stages of the machine learning process were: 

  - Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
  - Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
  - Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data (to resample the data and achieve a balanced dataset, I used the RandomOverSampler method)
  - Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
  
   More details on the process are below. 
## Results

* Logistic Regression Model:

## Summary
With the original data, the logistic regression model predicted 95.5% of `0`(healthy loan) and 90% of `1` (high-risk loan) accurately. While these resulta are good, it is crucial to increase the accuracy of `1` predictions (to identify high-risk loans). 
With the resampled data, the accuracy score for both `1` and `0` loans increased to 99%. The percentage of the accurate predictions and recall increased as well. 


## Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

1. Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

## Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
  - Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
  - Generate a confusion matrix.
  - Print the classification report.
4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

## Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. You should write this report as the README.md file included in your GitHub repository.

Structure your report by using the report template that Starter_Code.zip includes, ensuring that it contains the following:
 - An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 - The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
 - A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
